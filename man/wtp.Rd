\title{"Willingness to Pay" for fmlogit models}
\usage{
wtp(object, wtp.vec, varlist = NULL, indv.obs = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An "fmlogit.margins" object.}

\item{wtp.vec}{A 1*J vector that contains the willingness to pay for each choice j.}

\item{varlist}{A string vector which provides the name of variables to calculate 
the wtp. If missing, all variables in object will be calculated.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the estimates, standard error, z-stats, and p-value.
}
\description{
Calculates the willingness to pay for fractional multinomial logit models.
}
\details{
This function calculates the aggregate effect of a variable on the 
"willingness to pay" by linearly multiplying the average partial effect with ex-ante (arbitary) 
willingness to pay numbers associated with each choice. 

Suppose there are three choices A,B,C, each with a willingness to pay (or cost, profit, budget),
of 100, 200, and 300. The discrete effect of variable X on A,B and C are 0.5, 0.5, and -1, with 
standard error 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5. The aggregated discrete effect of X on the total willingness 
to pay (or cost), is thus 100*0.5 + 200*0.5 + 300*(-1) = -150. And the standard error can be also
calculated to be 162.8, assuming that the standard error is independent. 
A simple z-test is provided to test whether the aggregate effect is different from zero. 

Note that if the input fmlogit.margins object has no standard error computation, then no standard error

#results1 = fmlogit(y,X)
#effects1 = effects(results1,effect="marginal",se=T)
# assume that the WTP = 1,2,3,...J for each choice j.
